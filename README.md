## Course Description and Rationale


In this seminar, we will explore the exciting field of computational text analysis, also known as text-as-data. As our world becomes increasingly digital, vast amounts of legal, political, scientific, and journalistic text data have become available for analysis. This course is designed to introduce advanced undergraduate and graduate students to foundational concepts and practical applications of studying computational text analysis.

Politics is about conflict and cooperation between societal groups. Harold Lasswell once defined it as "who gets what, when, how?". Actors in the political arena, be it politicians, lobbyists, or mass movements, engage in (distributional) conflicts through language â€” be it spoken out loud in speeches, dialogues, and protest chants, or written down in position papers, protocols, and regulations. Throughout the seminar, students will learn how to use computational methods to explore the traces of conflict and cooperation preceding political change.

We will focus on a policy field that not only affects every university student personally but also one that has been at the forefront of global change: Education. Over the past century, education has expanded from being a privilege of the few to an almost universal and global experience. In Europe, this trend is now increasingly leading to educational upgrading and a massive expansion of higher education. But how has this quiet revolution come about? And what are the central conflicts of educational governance today?
The seminar is organized in three stages of the learning process. First, students will learn about the foundations of text-as-data in political science, as well as central theories of education politics. Further, they will study how to manually analyze texts without computational assistance. Next, we will focus on the methods of computational text analysis. Students will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of computational text analysis as well as the use of text-as-data methods through hands-on exercises using the R statistical programming language. We will also discuss recent examples of empirical research using computational text analysis. Last but not least, students will apply the learned methods in an in-class project. Small groups of students will be provided with textual data on a policy process and subsequently implement one or several of the techniques learned throughout the seminar
